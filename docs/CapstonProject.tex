	Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been extensively studied, and a range of GANs architectures and related methods are proposed. The evolution of GANs make significant impact in the areas of computer vision, thus great advances have been made for insatance plausible image generation, image-to-image translation, facial attribute manipulation and related domains. Most of recently works have focused on a lot of domains instead of focused on single domain of GANs. Because of that, in this works, we want to focus on the applications in a single area named facial attribute manipulation, an interesting area of GANs. We apply the state of the arts architectures and methods of GANs in facial attribute manipulation for edditing hairstyle of given facial image.

    \textbf{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)} are attracting a lot of researchers in deep learning community because of the challenges and interesting problems, which GANs provide. GANs have knowned as an area of computer vision, however, the applications of GANs have been applied to other domains such as natural language processing (NLP), time series synthesis, semantic segmentation, etc. GANs is a member of generative models family in machine learning. GANs offer advantages when compare to other generative model e.g., variational autoencoders such as an ability to handle sharp estimated density function, efficiently generating desired samples, eliminating deterministic bias and with good compatibility with the internal neural architectures. These properties of GANs help this networks success especially in the field of computer vision such as plausible image generation, image-to-image translation,  image super-resolution, facial attribute manipulation, etc.
